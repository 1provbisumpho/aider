If you want to learn more about plumbing design and estimate, Plumbing Design and Estimate by Max Fajardo is a great resource to have. It will help you master the skills and knowledge needed to design and estimate plumbing systems for any type of building.

In addition to providing a comprehensive guide for plumbing design and estimate, Plumbing Design and Estimate by Max Fajardo also offers some useful tips and tricks for master plumbers who want to improve their skills and efficiency. Here are some of the tips that you can learn from this book:
  
- Make a list of rooms present in the house or the building and the number of water outlets you will require for each room. This will help you plan the layout and size of the pipes and fittings.[^1^]
- Always remember that your plumbing plan should create a scalable design that can accommodate future changes or expansions. Be practical with all of your designs and avoid unnecessary complications or wastage.[^1^]
- Embrace BIM (Building Information Modeling) as a tool to enhance your plumbing design and collaboration with other contractors. BIM can help you create 3D models, perform analysis and feasibility studies, manage fabrication and procurement, and track project progress and assets.[^2^]
- Get involved as early as possible in the project and communicate with the general contractor and other subcontractors. This will help you avoid conflicts, errors, delays, and rework. It will also help you establish trust and reputation with your clients and partners.[^2^]
- Indicate the pipe sizes and the exact type of every fitting on your plumbing plan. Use codes or symbols to label them clearly and consistently. This will help you avoid confusion, mistakes, and disputes during installation and inspection.[^3^]
- Add a drain-waste-vent elevation to your plumbing plan to show the vertical alignment of the pipes and fittings. This will help you ensure proper slope, drainage, venting, and clearance of the system.[^3^]
- Use a plumbing cost estimator to calculate your installation costs based on your hourly rate, material costs, labor costs, overhead costs, and profit margin. You can use software or online tools to help you with this task. This will help you create accurate and professional estimates for your clients.[^4^]

By following these tips, you can improve your plumbing design and estimate skills and deliver high-quality work for your clients. Plumbing Design and Estimate by Max Fajardo is a valuable resource that can help you achieve this goal.
